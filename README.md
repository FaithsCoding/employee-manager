## Installation

Node, MySQL

## Usage

To use my application you need to have installed and created a MySQL login. You also need to have node and VS code installed. You will then need to clone down the repo. Once you have done this you have to run mysql -u root -p then login, you will then need to run source db/schema.sql then source db/schema.sql and then type exit. You then need to do a npm i in your terminal and finally to run the app you need to enter node index.js
